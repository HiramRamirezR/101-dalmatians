  <h1>101 Dalmatians</h1>
  <p>
    Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)... He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!
    By the button provided, you will find out exactly how you should respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.
  </p>
  <label for="dogsNumber">Number of dogs:</label>
  <input type="number" id="dogsNumber">
  <code>function howManyDalmatians(number) { </code>
  <code>let dogs = ["Hardly any", "More than a handful!", "Woah that's a lot of dogs!", "101 DALMATIANS!!!"]</code>

    return number <= 10 ? dogs[0] : number <= 50 ? dogs[1] : number === 101 ? dogs[3] : dogs[2]
  }
